h1. savon Handsoap shootout

I was recently scanning the web for a SOAP-client-library written in Ruby that would fit nicely into our platform. We needed to integrate lots of Web-services to build some Ruby-Web-clients for our callcenter-agents to work with.

I had a look into "The Ruby Toolbox":http://ruby-toolbox.com/categories/soap.html and decided to crunch the two most popuplar libraries at that time. So my two candidates were "savon":http://github.com/rubiii/savon and "Handsoap":http://github.com/unwire/handsoap/, both open-source-projects hosted on "github":http://github.com/.

h2. Scope

I will just cover the aspects that were relevant for our platform. You wont see all the features both libraries offer, but I hope that you get a glance on how to work with the two clients and which one might be the best choice for yourself.

h2. Features

There were different types of SOAP-services that we need to cover with the Ruby-clients. Third-Party-services, Inhouse-Development, mostly based on Java-RPC-SOAP-Frameworks like "Apache-CXF":http://cxf.apache.org/ or "Apache-Axis":http://ws.apache.org/axis/.

The requirements the SOAP-client should meet were clear. Having lots of Java-Guys around, there was no great focus on things like API-design or Ruby-magic, the client should _just work_!
Living in a Java-environment, it would be a great plus for the SOAP-client to integrate with "JRuby":http://jruby.org/ _smoothly_ (experience reminded us, a lot of Ruby-libraries lack JRuby support).
