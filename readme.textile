h1. Savon Handsoap Shootout

p. This is a technical Article on the two popular SOAP-Clients Savon (http://github.com/rubiii/savon) and Handsoap (http://github.com/unwire/handsoap/).

p. If you want to execute the examples, there are some rake-tasks for your convenience.

h2. Which versions are being compared?

p. We try to always compare the latest versions of both libraries. Right now we use: *Savon 0.6.8* and *Handsoap 1.1.4*.

h2. Getting started

p. "Download":http://github.com/phoet/savon_handsoap_shootout/archives/master or clone the repository via:

bc. git clone git://github.com/phoet/savon_handsoap_shootout.git

h2. How to use

p. Run "rake" to execute the specifications. The default rake task executing the specs will exit unless all public SOAP services are available. Look at the examples comparing the use of Savon and Handsoap in the "lib/shootout" folder.

h2. How to help

p. If you own or know about a public SOAP service that we could use, please get in touch.

h2. Problems?

p. In case of a LoadError, please make sure *Rubygems* is used (see http://gist.github.com/54177).
