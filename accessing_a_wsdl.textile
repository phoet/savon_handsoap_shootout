h2. Accessing a WSDL

p. Both clients provide an interface to work with a wsdl. While handsoap wsdl-support is hidden in some helper-class, wsdls are a first-class citizen in savon. The code for printing out the available SOAP-actions looks like this:

bc.. # using handsoap
require "handsoap/parser"
wsdl = Handsoap::Parser::Wsdl.read(@wsdl_uri)
wsdl.bindings.each {|binding| binding.actions.each{|action| p action.name }}

# using savon
p Savon::Client.new("some_wsdl").wsdl.soap_actions

p. The handsoap-parser-class is part of the Rails generator. The generator can be used for creating a Handsoap service class skeleton and tests.

bc.. $ script/generate handsoap http://www.thomas-bayer.com/axis2/services/BLZService?wsdl

p. This call will output something like:

bc..      exists  app
      exists  app/models
      create  app/models/blz_service.rb
      exists  test
      exists  test/integration
      create  test/integration/blz_service_test.rb
----
Endpoints in WSDL
  You should copy these to the appropriate environment files.
  (Eg. `config/environments/*.rb`)
----
# wsdl: http://www.thomas-bayer.com/axis2/services/BLZService?wsdl
BLZ_SERVICE_ENDPOINT = {
  :uri => 'http://www.thomas-bayer.com:80/axis2/services/BLZService',
  :version => 2
}
----

p. The skeleton provides method-stubs, for adding request-parameters and result-parsing:

bc.. def get_bank
  soap_action = ''
  response = invoke('tns:getBank', soap_action) do |message|
    raise "TODO"
  end
end
