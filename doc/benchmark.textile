h2. Benchmark

p. As every benchmark is only as good as the platform it is run on, everyone should execute them on their own machine. This is as simple as executing a rake task:

bc.. $ rake benchmark

p. Running the benchmarks on my local development machine (MacBook 2.4GH Intel Core 2 Duo) produces these results:

bc..                                     user     system      total        real
savon dynamic                   0.390000   0.070000   0.460000 ( 17.860459)
savon static                    0.120000   0.040000   0.160000 ( 11.929432)
handsoap                        0.100000   0.020000   0.120000 (  3.962274)

p. Since Handsoap uses native C libraries like "curb":http://curb.rubyforge.org and "nokogiri":http://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/ the produced results are not that surprising. Savon on the other hand is a pure Ruby implementation with only a small set of dependencies.

p. Handsoap offers a way to change the underlying gems to work with HTTP and XML parsing. There are some more benchmarks for these configurations:

bc..                                      user     system      total        real
