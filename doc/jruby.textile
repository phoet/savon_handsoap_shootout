h2. JRuby

p. First of all, both client-implementations can be run using JRuby. Since Savon is a pure Ruby implementation you get JRuby support for free. The drawback is, that it's slow on MRI. Using native C-Libraries by default, Handsoap is bleezing fast. But when it comes to terms of compatibility with JRuby you've got to fall back to core Ruby classes:

bc.. Handsoap.http_driver = :net_http
Handsoap.xml_query_driver = :rexml

p. Using this configuration nearly elimininates the differences in performance.
